Hii! What's up?
How it going?
Today I had my End Term Practical of DBMS.
I stated the test and around 50 mins were given to complete the Exam.
I successfully ran both the queries in 7 mins(Thala For a Reason).
Then I had to complete 10 mcqs which were kind of easy.
But then came the tricky part, Answering questions on paper.
The first question asked for an explanation of how SQL works with Database Management Systems (DBMS) - 
It is like asking someone to explain the working
The question was "What is the difference between SQL Server and Oracle?"
